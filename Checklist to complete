implement the Affine Cipher that provides both encryption and decryption operations. -DONE
a and b are your private encryption keys. These keys will also be used during decryption -DONE
user the option to either encrypt or decrypt a plaintext that is chosen from the English alphabet
The user should be prompted to enter a plaintext and arbitrary keys (a and b with gcd(a, 26) = 1) to be used in the encryption process
will convert each character of your plaintext into an integer between 0 and 25. 
Then you should encrypt/decrypt the sequence. After the process, you will again convert the numbers into letters (A for 0, B for 1, C for 2, and soon). 
The output should be text printed to console. -DONE
letters should be first converted to their uppercase equivalents before encryption and decryption. 
White spaces should be maintained while all other characters should be discarded
elegant program that minimizes the repetition of common code.
Comments should be used to explain everything not obvious from the code -DONE
A flow diagram for encryption and decryption program should be provided as well (functional design) where it contains a diagram of the functions you have implemented.
